            <p>My name is Simran and I am a Term 1 student.I am <strong><em>really</em></strong> enjoying the programming courses as it gives a different perspective to relate the real world objects to coding. BCIT has <strong>very</strong> high
                standards for CIT program and my instructors are
                <em><strong>highly</strong></em> effective in teaching
                <em>useful</em> technical skills. My fellow classmates are
                <em>actually</em> helpful and always try to solve problems together
                to work as a team. I am having an
                <strong>amazing</strong> experience of learning skills and
                establishing <em>great</em> friendships with my peers.

          <p>
            I really like Christmas lights and my photo is a
            <b><em>very</em></b> clear example of that. It was clicked at
            Vancouver Night Lights by my friend.This is one of my
            <em><b>favourite</b></em> photos. I love clicking photos and you will find the collection of my photos at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ssiiimmrann/" target="_blank" title="instagram profile">my instagram profile</a> which is my favourite social media platform these days.
